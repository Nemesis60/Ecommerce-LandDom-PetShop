Redux pattern:
    reducers -> store -> actions and repeat de sequence 

    Store: where the data is stored

        -Provider: contain all application to use Store
        that help to use store in all components
    -------------------------------
    Slide: function that accepts an initial state an object reducers functions and
        a "slice name"

        -initialState: is the initial state is like the default stats
            before begin.

        -Reducer: functions that contain the logic and calculation that 
        needed to be performed on the state. These functions accept
        the initial state of the state being used and the action type. 
        It updates the state and responds with the new state.

        -actions: functions that allow to call since interface
        all state updates
    --------------------------
    useDispatch: functions that i want to call for to be able
        to update the state functions

    useSelector: fetch the data stored in de state
